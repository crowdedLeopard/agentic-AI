Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data. They are capable of understanding and generating human-like text for a wide range of tasks.

## Key Concepts

*   **Transformers:** The underlying architecture for most modern LLMs.
*   **Training Data:** The massive datasets used to train these models.
*   **Fine-tuning:** Adapting a pre-trained LLM for specific tasks.

LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, and Llama have revolutionized natural language processing.
