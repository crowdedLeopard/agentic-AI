Creating an AI agent involves defining its goals, sensors, actuators, and decision-making logic. Let's build a simple example.

```python
class SimpleAgent:
    def __init__(self, goal):
        self.goal = goal

    def perceive(self, environment):
        # Get information from the environment
        pass

    def decide(self, state):
        # Choose an action based on the state
        pass

    def act(self, action):
        # Perform the chosen action
        pass
```

This basic structure can be expanded with more sophisticated planning and learning algorithms.
