As AI agents become more autonomous and capable, ethical considerations are paramount.

## Major Concerns

1.  **Bias:** Agents trained on biased data can perpetuate societal inequalities.
2.  **Accountability:** Who is responsible when an autonomous agent causes harm?
3.  **Transparency:** Understanding how agents make decisions (explainability).
4.  **Job Displacement:** The potential impact on the human workforce.

Addressing these challenges requires careful design, regulation, and ongoing public discourse.
